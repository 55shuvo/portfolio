                <q>Humble and Grumble </q>by Eldred Herbert   
            </h3>
            <pre>
                Humble and Grumble were identical twins,
                And Humble was ever so meek;
                Grumble did nothing but grumble all day,
                Some may even call him a freak.

                Humble was happy and everyone’s friend,
                Grumble was jealous of course;
                Humble was happy to follow the Lord,
                But Grumble, an immoral source.

                Humble was never seen wearing a frown,
                And Grumble, ne’er seen with a smile;
                Humble won friends by just being himself,
                But, Grumble, he won them by guile.

                So Grumble, please follow Humble, your twin,
                And Humble, don’t grumble, I pray,
                For grumble will make you like Grumble, your twin,
                Please Grumble, be humble today.
